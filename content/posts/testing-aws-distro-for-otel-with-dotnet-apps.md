# Introduction

A few months ago I wrote a post about how to start using OpenTelemetry with .NET, if you're interested you can read more about it [here](https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/getting-started-with-opentelemetry-and-dotnet-core/).   
In that post I talked a little bit about the main concepts around OpenTelemetry and how to instrument a .NET app with the .NET OpenTelemetry client.

In this post I'm going to get back to OpenTelemetry and .NET, but this time I'm planning to focus on testing the **AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry**.

With the AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry you can instrument your application to send metrics and traces to multiple AWS solutions such as AWS CloudWatch, Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus, AWS X-Ray or Amazon OpenSearch Service.   

It also can collect metadata from your AWS resources and managed services, so you can correlate application performance data with underlying infrastructure data, reducing the mean time to problem resolution.

As I stated before the goal for this post is testing distributed tracing with AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry in .NET, so during this post I'll be tackling the following topics:
- How to setup the AWS OTEL Collector.
- How to configure properly a .NET app and how to use XRay to view them.

But first of all, let's review the demo I'm going to build during this post.

# Demo

The demo has 4 apps. These apps are not doing any business logic operations because that's not the goal here.
The important part is that all the apps are talking with AWS services like S3, DynamoDb, AmazonMQ RabbitMQ or SQS.

Here's the diagram:

![components-diagram]((/img/aws-otel-demo-components-diagram.png)

- **App1.WebApi** is a .NET6 Web API with 2 endpoints.
    - The ``/http`` endpoint  makes an HTTP request to the **App2** ``/dummy`` endpoint.
    - The ``/publish-message``  endpoint queues a message into an **AWS ActiveMQ Rabbit queue**.

- **App2.RabbitConsumer.Console** is a .NET6 console app. 
  - Dequeues messages from the Rabbit queue and makes a HTTP request to the **App3** ``/s3-to-event`` endpoint with the content of the message.

- **App3.WebApi** is a .NET6 Web API with 2 endpoints.
    - The ``/dummy`` endpoint returns a fixed "Ok" response.
    - The ``/s3-to-event`` endpoint receives a message via HTTP POST, stores it in an **S3 bucket** and afterwards publishes the message as an event into an **AWS SQS queue**.

- **App4.SqsConsumer.HostedService** is a .NET6 Worker Service.
  - A Hosted Service reads the messages from the **AWS SQS queue** and stores it into a **DynamoDb table**.

# AWS OpenTelemetry Collector

The collector in our distro is built using the upstream OpenTelemetry collector. We have added AWS-specific exporters to the upstream collector to send data to AWS services including AWS X-Ray, Amazon CloudWatch and Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus.

# How to run the demo

If you want to take a look at the demo, I have uploaded everything on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/karlospn/aws-otel-tracing-demo)

The ``/cdk`` folder contains a CDK app that creates the AWS Resources needed to run the demo.   
The repository also contains a **docker-compose** file that starts up the 4 apps and the AWS OTEL collector, but there is **some work** that needs to be done in the docker-compose file before you can execute it:

- If you take a look at the compose file you'll see that there are a few values that **MUST** be replaced:
    - ``<ADD-AWS-USER-ACCESS-KEY>``
    - ``<ADD-AWS-USER-SECRET-KEY>``
    - ``<ADD-AMAZONMQ-RABBIT-HOST-ENDPOINT>``
    - ``<ADD-S3-BUCKET-NAME>``
    - ``<ADD-SQS-URI>``

After running the CDK app, you'll find the correct values in the output of the CDK app. Here's an example of how the output of the AWS CDK app looks like:

And here's an example of how the docker-compose looks like after replacing the placeholder values:

```yaml

```

To summarize, if you want to run this demo you'll need to do the following steps:
- Execute the CDK app on your AWS account.
- Replace the values on the docker-compose.
- Execute ``docker-compose up``.
