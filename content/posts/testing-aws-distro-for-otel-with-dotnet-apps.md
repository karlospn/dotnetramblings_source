As always if you donâ€™t care about the post I have upload the source code on my [Github](https://github.com/karlospn/aws-otel-tracing-demo).

# Introduction

AWS OTEL is a secure, production-ready, AWS-supported distribution of the OpenTelemetry project.

With AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry, you can instrument your applications just once to send correlated metrics and traces to multiple AWS and Partner monitoring solutions.

It also collects metadata from your AWS resources and managed services, so you can correlate application performance data with underlying infrastructure data, reducing the mean time to problem resolution.

And this repository contains a practical example about how to use AWS OTEL for tracing when we have a series of distributed .NET apps.

# OpenTelemetry .NET Client

# How to run the demo

If you want to take a look at the demo, I have uploaded everything on my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/karlospn/aws-otel-tracing-demo)

The ``/cdk`` folder contains a CDK app that creates the AWS Resources needed to run the demo.   
The repository also contains a **docker-compose** file that starts up the 4 apps and the AWS OTEL collector, but there is **some work** that needs to be done in the docker-compose file before you can execute it:

- If you take a look at the compose file you'll see that there are a few values that **MUST** be replaced:
    - ``<ADD-AWS-USER-ACCESS-KEY>``
    - ``<ADD-AWS-USER-SECRET-KEY>``
    - ``<ADD-AMAZONMQ-RABBIT-HOST-ENDPOINT>``
    - ``<ADD-S3-BUCKET-NAME>``
    - ``<ADD-SQS-URI>``

After running the CDK app, you'll find the correct values in the output of the CDK app. Here's an example of how the output of the AWS CDK app looks like:

And here's an example of how the docker-compose looks like after replacing the placeholder values:

```yaml

```

To summarize, if you want to run this demo you'll need to do the following steps:
- Execute the CDK app on your AWS account.
- Replace the values on the docker-compose.
- Execute ``docker-compose up``.
