Let me start this post by clarifying that **I don't intend to build a fully functional Azure DevOps Copilot**, as the Azure DevOps REST API is too big and my spare time is quite limited.

Instead, I plan to create a Copilot that uses a small subset of the Azure DevOps API endpoints. My primary goal is to demonstrate how simple it can be to build your own custom Copilot using Semantic Kernel Plugins.


# **What is Semantic Kernel?**

Semantic Kernel is an open-source SDK designed to facilitate the development of intelligent applications.

It provides a set of tools and libraries that enable developers to build applications capable of understanding, processing, and reasoning about data in a more human-like manner.

Do you know LangChain? Well, Semantic Kernel is a similar alternative.
