If you work regularly with .NET you probably heard about Roslyn Analyzers, and if you don't know anything about them it's quite possible that you have being used them without knowing it.

The .NET SDK includes quite a few Roslyn Analyzers starting with Visual Studio 2019 and .NET 5.0, which means that when you create a new .NET app in Visual Studio, you'll see that it comes with a few a Roslyn Analyzers packages already preconfigured from the get-go.

Currently you don't see much talk about Roslyn Analyzers, but they are still the de facto way when you want to perform any kind of static analysis in your codebase.   
If you own any kind of NuGet package, having a set of Roslyn analyzers to help enforce the correct usage and setup of your library might be a really nice offering.

On the other hand, SonarQube is one of the most well-known tools for performing static code analysis, it comes prepacked with a huge array of [csharp rules](https://rules.sonarsource.com/csharp) to try to enforce best practices, but what can we do if we want to add our custom Roslyn rules into SonarQube?    

What are the available options if we want to integrate Roslyn analyzers with SonarQube so that issues detected by the Roslyn analyzers are reported and managed in SonarQube?

There are 2 ways to add Roslyn analyzers rules to SonarQube:

- Create a Java plugin from the Roslyn Analyzer and install it into SonarQube.
- Import the issues report generated by the Roslyn Analyzer into SonarQube.

**In this post I want to show you how you can integrate a Roslyn Analyzer with SonarQube using both ways: plugin and issues report.**   
**Also I'll enumerate the pros and cons of using each one of the available options.**
