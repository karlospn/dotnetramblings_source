A couple of months ago, I wrote a post about building a Q&A app using Azure OpenAI GPT-4 and Pinecone _(you can find it [here](https://www.mytechramblings.com/posts/building-a-csharp-enhancing-app-using-openai-gpt4-and-streamlit/))_.   

Now, I want to built a similar app but using **only AWS services** (+ Streamlit for the UI).

# **How can an LLM respond to a question about topics it doesn’t know about?**

# **What are knowledge database**

# **Which AWS services are we going to use?**

For the Generative AI LLM models, we will be using:
- [AWS Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock)

For the knowledge database, we will be using:
- [AWS Kendra](https://aws.amazon.com/kendra)
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3)

The next image shows a more precise diagram of how the AWS services are going to interact between them:
